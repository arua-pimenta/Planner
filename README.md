## 🌟 Inspired by the Best, Built for the Hardest
This project was deeply inspired by productivity paradigms but adapted, enhanced, and transformed into a specialized tool for the strenuous workflow of Medical School. From dynamic attendance tracking to custom exam types (OSCE, Practical, Seminars).

## 🤝 We Need Your Brains! (Contributions Welcome)
We are fully open to the Open Source community! Whether you are a senior Swift developer or a medical student with killer feature ideas, we want you! 

**How you can help:**
- 🐛 **Bug Hunting:** Find issues and report them.
- 💡 **Feature Requests:** Give us ideas on how to make this the ultimate Med Student companion.
- 💻 **Code Contributions:** Open Pull Requests for new features, iOS/iPadOS adaptations, or UI tweaks!

Check our issues tab to find *"Good First Issues"* and jump right in!

## 🚀 How to Download and Run
Since this app is built entirely natively using **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, and **SwiftData** with the latest Apple technologies, you will need **Xcode 15+** to run it.

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/arua-pimenta/planner.git`
2. Open the `Planner.xcodeproj` file in Xcode (macOS).
3. Build and Run (`Cmd + R`).
